# Learn C

"Learn C" is C book I made. It's available in two languages, [![English](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/markdown-here/raw/master/common/english.bmp "English")](English) and [![Polish](https://github.com/KrzysztofSzewczyk/markdown-here/raw/master/common/polish.bmp "Polish")](Polish)
 
Motivation is simple enough, I just wanted to share my knowledge about C programming.
Main language is Polish, but I'm going to translate it to English, when this book will reach some serious state.
